# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18)

**Core value:** When a new Covalence release is tagged in the app repo, this site rebuilds itself with the correct version, download, and release notes — with zero manual intervention — and visitors land on a page that explains what Covalence is clearly enough to decide whether to install it.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Releases Page (Phase 1 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Releases Page) — next up
Plan: 2 of 2 complete in Phase 1
Status: Phase 1 complete (awaiting verifier)
Last activity: 2026-04-19 — Completed quick task 260419-wks: Fix broken homepage anchor links in primary nav

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Standalone-repo GSD bootstrap (split from app monorepo Phase 12)
- Init: Coarse granularity (4 phases for 17 requirements)
- Init: No tests in v1 — acceptance is "build passes on CI + manual verification"
- Init: `repository_dispatch` payload shape is locked (cross-repo contract with app repo)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Site is live in production on `covalence.app` — any phase that touches routing, metadata, or the DMG download path must be verified against a Cloudflare Pages preview deploy before merging to `main`.
- Required-status-check configuration for CI-02 is a manual GitHub UI step (branch protection rules). Plan 1 should document this explicitly so it doesn't get skipped.
- Starlight is pre-1.0 (`^0.38.3`) and Astro is `^6.1.6` — CI gate from Phase 1 is the containment strategy for surprise breakage in those deps.
